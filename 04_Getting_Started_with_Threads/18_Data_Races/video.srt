00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,730
Hello again.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,510
In this video, we are going to look at data races. I am going to show you an example of a data race

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,260
and then discuss the kinds of problems that they can cause.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,170
So we remember the definition of a data race?

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,340
It is when we have accesses from multiple threads which are not ordered or atomic.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,080
So here is the code

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,150
that I am going to use to demonstrate this.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,900
It is quite similar to the example in the last video.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,860
We are going to have three threads which print a message to the screen.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,580
In the last video, I was careful to make sure that the threads could not print to the screen at the

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,590
same time, by putting sleeps in.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,810
And in effect, that means the threads run one after the other. In this case, I actually want the threads

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,540
to try to print to the screen at the same time.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:01:00,020
To do that, I have broken up the print statement into separate outputs of each character. So the thread

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,870
could be interrupted between each of these function calls [to operator 

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,910
There are three function calls as opposed to one, so that is three times as many opportunities to be interrupted.

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:17,050
And I have also put a sleep in here, which will give the scheduler more opportunities to interrupt threads

18
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,910
and let other threads run.

19
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,980
So let's see what happens when we run this.

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,820
That is an extremely boring example!

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,840
OK, this one is better.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,800
So the threat that prints "abc" runs first, it gets to print "a" and "b", then it gets interrupted before it can

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,780
do its final output

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:48,650
operator call. Then the "xyz" thread and the "def" thread both run and print all their output.

25
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,980
And then the "abc" thread wakes up again and it is able to output the final character.

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,780
So one of the things about data races is that they are not easily reproducible.

27
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,370
And that does not look like a data race at all! So it's like undefined behaviour, not necessarily predictable

28
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,070
and it can look as though everything is working fine.

29
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:26,270
OK. There is another one. So I think you've got the idea by now.
This is one that I prepared earlier,

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,040
as the Children's TV program says.

31
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,800
So you can see here we had interleaving where the first thread prints "a"

32
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,420
and it gets interrupted, the second thread prints "d", the first thread runs again and prints "b", the

33
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,340
second thread runs again and prints "e"

34
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,450
and "f".

35
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,080
And then

36
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:53,470
the first thread can run and print "c". So the interleaving process: threads appear to run in between

37
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,610
other threads.

38
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:02,260
So we have the "abc" thread running here and the "def" thread appears to run in between what the "abc" thread

39
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,710
is doing.

40
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,710
And that is called interleaving.

41
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,380
This oval is meant to be the program, this squiggle is meant to be one of the threads and this is meant

42
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,340
to be another one of the threads.

43
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:27,850
So if you imagine this is the "abc" thread and this is the "def" thread, this thread gets to run prints

44
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,480
"a" to the screen and it gets interrupted.

45
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,470
Then this thread can run, it prints "d" on the screen.

46
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,580
Then it gets interrupted.

47
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,170
And this thread runs again, prints "b" and so on.

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,330
So we end up with this interleaved output.

49
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,030
So we had a data race. We have several threads which are trying to access the same location, in this

50
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:03,630
case, the output object cout. There was no ordering between the threads, so we did not have them

51
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,340
"happening before" each other.

52
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:14,550
And the access was not atomic. In our program, we saw interleaved output, but that was quite lucky, really.

53
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,130
iostream is specially designed

54
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,280
so nothing worse than that can happen, if you have threads trying to write to an iostream at the same time.

55
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:32,240
You can get much worse consequences. For example, the results of computations can be incorrect. The

56
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,010
program flow can be incorrect, so it does not execute in the way that it should do.

57
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,870
We can get torn writes and reads, which mean that data is corrupted. And we can get objects which

58
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,100
are not being properly constructed or destroyed.

59
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:55,580
So let's go through these. By the way, the code in these examples is deliberately bad.
I do not recommend

60
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,780
that you write code like this!

61
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,360
The reason I have done this is to demonstrate the problem in a very short, simple bit of code.

62
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,940
We have a thread function which is doing some calculations on a shared variable x. So it does one

63
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,640
calculation here, the statement to calculate a, and another one to calculate b. If the thread is interrupted

64
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:26,040
between these two statements and another thread runs and changes the value of x, then the value of b is

65
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,830
going to be calculated using a different value of x from the one that was used to calculate a.

66
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,650
So the results a and b are going to be inconsistent.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,620
And this does not just happen between statements.

68
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,550
It can also happen within statements. As we saw in the print program where we have output operator

69
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,560
calls and threads could be interrupted between calling successive output operations.

70
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:56,780
For example, if we're squaring x, then adding two times x to it, and adding one, that is two multiplication

71
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,400
operations and two additions.

72
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,600
And the thread could be interrupted between any of those.

73
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,060
So when we are calculating x squared, we could use one value of x here. Then if we are interrupted

74
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,430
before doing the multiplication, then we could use a different value of x here.

75
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,790
Incorrect program flow. We are calculating a square root. We want to be careful and make sure that

76
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,250
the value is positive because it is an int and ints can have negative values.

77
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,010
And if we take the square root of a negative number, we get a runtime error.

78
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,040
So we test if it is safe to use x and then we take its square root.

79
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,970
If the threat gets interrupted between doing the test and doing the square root and another thread sets

80
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,080
the value of x to be negative, then we are going to get a run time exception here.

81
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,160
But how is that possible?

82
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,560
We checked the value of x, didn't we.

83
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,710
Incorrect program flow.

84
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:05,690
We have a switch statement where we call different functions, depending on the value of x. We want

85
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,360
to make sure that x is within range because our case statements go from zero to nine.

86
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,460
So we check the value of x before we go into the switch.

87
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,540
And - maybe you've guessed by now - if the thread gets interrupted between doing the check by some other

88
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,940
thread that changes the value of x, then this is not going to work as expected.

89
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,620
If it sets x to 10, then none of the cases will match and it will just jump over and out of the switch

90
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,110
statement.

91
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:41,810
And for bonus points, there is an even nastier bug hiding in here. Compilers are allowed to do lots

92
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,960
of things to the code to optimize it.

93
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,840
One of the common optimizations for a case statement is to convert it to a branch table.

94
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:59,150
The compiler will generate some code which creates an array, the indexes of this array will be the

95
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,920
case labels, and the elements will be pointers to the functions that get called.

96
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:12,560
If, for example, the value of x is zero, then the program will go to the element with index zero and

97
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,830
it will call the function in there, which will cause it to call a().

98
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,580
And the problem is, if we have an interruption which sets the value of x to 10, the program will go to the

99
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,170
element within the index 10, which is not actually part of the array, because the highest index is

100
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:33,180
nine, and it is going to execute the function there, which could be any arbitrary code.

101
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,390
So who knows what could happen then!

102
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:46,590
Torn writes and reads, These are actually very difficult to demonstrate on current hardware.

103
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:53,880
If you're using something like ARM or PowerPC from the 2000s, then there are some cases where this

104
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,360
could happen.

105
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,380
These are 32 bit systems, but they have instructions which can take 64 bit arguments.

106
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,800
So, for example, you can save a 64 bit integer.

107
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:11,360
The addresses where the integer gets saved can only store 32 bits, so this is done by splitting

108
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,900
the number into half. The first half gets written into one memory address and the second half is written into

109
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,390
the memory address next to it.

110
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:27,870
The problem occurs when we have two threads which are writing to that location at the same time, so

111
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,980
the first thread will write the first half of this number to the first address.

112
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:38,780
Then it gets interrupted. Another thread will run and write both halves of its number to the two addresses.

113
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,450
So it is going to overwrite what is in the first half of the address.

114
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,750
Then the original thread will start again.

115
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,010
It'll write the second half of its number into the second half of the address.

116
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,740
So that'll overwrite what the thread "B" just put there.

117
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,220
So we're going to end up with a number that has the first half of thread A's number [sic] and the second

118
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,530
half of thread B's number [sic].

119
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,530
It's as if you'd written down thread A's number and thread B's number on pieces of paper and then torn

120
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,960
them in half and swapped them around.

121
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,000
So we have the first half of A and the second half of B. Sorry, the first half...

122
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,320
So we have the first half of B and the second half of A.

123
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:25,140
And we can also have a torn read, which happens when a thread, which is reading, is interrupted by

124
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,430
another thread which is writing.

125
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,950
So the reading thread will get the first half of the number, then the writing thread will overwrite that

126
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,380
and put a different value in the second half of that number.

127
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,040
And then the reading thread will pick up that new value from the second half.

128
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,870
So it will be the number, which again is a mixture of two different values.

129
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,860
Improper construction. If we imagine a thread which is creating an object and it calls the object's

130
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:59,370
constructor. While it is doing that, it is interrupted by another thread, which is also calling a constructor

131
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,070
on the same memory location.

132
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,420
And that's going to give us a torn write.

133
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:10,380
If we imagine the constructor has several initialization statements and some of those get executed

134
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,390
by one thread and some of those get executed by another thread, we are going to have a torn

135
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,760
write.

136
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,140
And the object is going to be initialized with a mixture of values from each thread.

137
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,610
Another horrible bit of code!

138
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:31,790
We have a situation where we have a class with inheritance and in the base class, the base class will

139
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,660
push an instance of itself onto a vector of pointers to the base.

140
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,210
As you probably know, when you have a derived class object, that contains an instance of the base class

141
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,520
object and that base class object is created before the derived class constructor is called.

142
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,760
So if we call the derived class constructor, it'll call the base class constructor.

143
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:01,210
The base class constructor will push back a pointer to the partially constructed base object.

144
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,050
And then if some other thread accesses that element of the vector before the derived class constructor

145
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,340
has run, then it is only going to see a partially constructed object.

146
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:21,240
And finally, improper destruction. You probably know about the shared_ptr in C++11, which is a reference

147
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:21,990
counted object.

148
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:29,480
The idea is that every time a reference to the object is destroyed, a counter is decremented. When

149
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,800
the counter goes down to zero,

150
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,530
that means the last reference has been destroyed and then we can delete the object and its management

151
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:36,900
data.

152
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,970
So imagine we try to implement this ourselves.

153
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,110
Obviously, the real shared_ptr does not suffer from this.

154
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,030
It has been designed intelligently.

155
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,320
But if we try to write it ourselves and get it wrong, then something like this could happen.

156
00:12:52,130 --> 00:13:01,470
We have an integer which is decremented, and then we check if it is equal to zero. In a threaded program,

157
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:07,330
we could have two threads which are destroying their reference at the same time.

158
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:14,300
And if one threat gets interrupted after doing the decrement, but before doing the check, then we

159
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,090
can have the situation where the reference count has the wrong value.

160
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:25,630
If the reference count is two, then one thread decrements it down to one and then it gets interrupted, then the next thread

161
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,680
will take it down to zero.

162
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:34,870
Then that thread will see the reference count equal to zero and the first thread, when it runs again, will also see that the

163
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,140
reference count is equal to zero.

164
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,160
So these deletions are done twice.

165
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,990
On the other hand, if the reference count is one initially, then the first thread will decrement it to zero,

166
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,280
then it gets interrupted.

167
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,810
The second thread decrements it to minus one, then both sides will see a value of minus one.

168
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,910
So this check fails and the deletion is not done.

169
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,980
So in fact, we have a memory leak.

170
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,020
So data races are pretty nasty things, how do you manage them?

171
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,730
The only real answer is not to allow them to occur in the first place.

172
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,730
As we have seen, they occur intermittently. It requires some kind of timing coincidence to actually

173
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,090
trigger bugs, and they're also sensitive to environment as well.

174
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,510
Sometimes they only occur under heavy load.

175
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,470
So the best way to deal with data races is to make sure they do not happen in the first place.

176
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,070
So if we think back to the definition of a data race where we have accesses from different threads,

177
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,150
we have accesses which are not ordered and we have accesses which are not atomic.

178
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,550
So to avoid a data race, you do the opposite of those.

179
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,820
So we make all the accesses in the same thread.

180
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,140
So do not share data between different threads unless it is absolutely necessary.

181
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,950
Or we can make the accesses "atomic", which we will look at later on in the course.

182
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:06,470
So we use shared data which can be accessed using so-called "atomic" operations, which can't be interrupted.

183
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:13,520
Or we can make each access happen before the next, so we impose some kind of ordering on how threads access

184
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,060
shared data, and we will be looking at that in the next section of this course.

185
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,210
Until then, keep coding!
