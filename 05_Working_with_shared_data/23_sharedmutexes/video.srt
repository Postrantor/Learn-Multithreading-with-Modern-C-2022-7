00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,880
Hello again.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,870
In this video, we are going to look at shared mutexes.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,610
So we now know how to use mutexes to make sure that only one thread can execute in a critical region

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,570
at any one time.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:20,470
That is very useful, but occasionally it is a bit too restrictive.
Let's imagine that we have a situation

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:28,150
where we have some data which is accessed for reading very frequently, but only very rarely modified.

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:35,730
If we use the techniques we have learnt so far, this means that every time a thread wants to read this

8
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:42,660
shared data, it has to get an exclusive lock on it and no other threads can access it, even if it is

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,680
just to read it.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,200
So this means if we have, say, 1000 threads which read the data and only one thread which writes

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,330
to it, then 999 times out of 1000, we are looking the mutex when we do not need to.

12
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,720
And that is going to have a big effect on performance.

13
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:07,020
On the other hand, on the occasional time when there is a thread which modifies the data, then we

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,040
want to make sure that all the reading threads are locked out to prevent a data race.

15
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,860
So we cannot just take the mutexes off.

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,140
If you were using C++11, there was not very much you could do about this, at least not using standard

17
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:28,370
C++.
C++14 provided a mutex which could be used for this and a type of lock.

18
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:36,320
C++17 improved the mutex by removing the timeout functions, which the C++14 mutex had.

19
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,870
So let's find out how all this works,

20
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,400
The C++17 shared mutex, which we are going to look at, is defined in the  header.

21
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,430
There are actually two different ways in which it can be locked.

22
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:00,220
The first one is exactly the same as every other mutex that we have looked at so far, which is to get

23
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,180
an exclusive lock.

24
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:08,800
If a thread has an exclusive lock on this mutex, then no other thread can acquire a lock until this

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,030
thread releases the lock.

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:19,330
There is also a shared lock. When a threat has a shared lock, any other thread can also acquire a shared

27
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:19,930
lock on the mutex.

28
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,650
It does not have to wait for this thread to release the lock.

29
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:32,030
If another thread wants to get an exclusive lock, it has to wait until all the threads which have shared

30
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,310
locks release them.

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,550
And also if the thread has an exclusive lock, then no one can get a shared lock until that is released.

32
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:49,140
To get an exclusive lock is exactly the same as the other mutexes, so we can use lock_guard, unique_lock

33
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,540
or scoped_lock as we wish.

34
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,950
This will give the thread exclusive access to the critical region.

35
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,220
Only one thread can access it. If another thread wants to access the critical region,

36
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,180
it will have to wait until this thread releases the exclusive lock.

37
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,450
There is also a shared_lock which provides shared access.

38
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,210
Any thread can share access to the critical region with other threads which also have shared locks.

39
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,630
If there is a thread which has an exclusive lock, then the thread will have to wait to acquire its shared lock.

40
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,090
So how would we use this in code?

41
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:38,600
We would create an instance of the shared mutex. We would create read and write task functions.

42
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:45,110
The write function will get an exclusive lock on the mutex, so only one thread can write to the shared data at

43
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,800
any one time.

44
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:54,050
The reader threads will get shared locks on the mutex so any thread can read the data provided that

45
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,950
no-one is writing to it.

46
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,100
So let's have a look at some code that does this. So here we are.

47
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,510
I have got a write task function.

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,470
This gets a lock guard on the mutex.

49
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,820
So this is going to acquire an exclusive look.

50
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,510
While this write task is executing its critical region, no other thread can access it.

51
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:24,440
The read test function takes a shared lock on the mutex, so we could have many threads executing this

52
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,870
read task at the same time. And instead of sharing data, I am just going to print out a number, which

53
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,580
depends on the threads.

54
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:41,920
I have included the shared_mutex header. In the main() function, I am creating lots of threads which read

55
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,980
and one thread which writes. When you want to create lots of threat objects, it is useful to put them

56
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,800
into a vector.

57
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,640
Then when you populate the vector, the thread objects cannot be copied, but they can be moved.

58
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,670
So this is going to transfer ownership of the underlying system thread from the thread object into

59
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,690
the vector element.

60
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:10,430
So I create some reading threads here, I create a writer thread, and then I create some more reading

61
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:10,790
threads.

62
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,900
And then finally I iterate over the threads and join each one.

63
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,000
I need to use the reference version of auto here because the thread objects cannot be copied.

64
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,090
Okay, so let's see how this works.

65
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,140
So we have some reading threads start up.

66
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,560
They all get a shared lock and they can all access the critical region.

67
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,110
The write thread gets an exclusive lock and now all the read threads which come afterwards have to wait.

68
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,430
And when - yes, there it is! - the write thread releases its look and then the other reading threads

69
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,120
can run.

70
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,820
And you will notice the output is slightly scrambled up.

71
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,620
OK.

72
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,720
Let's remind ourselves about the conditions for a data race.

73
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,850
I am going to keep displaying this slide until you see it in your dreams! Or perhaps that should be nightmares!!

74
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,170
So the condition for a data race is when we have:

75
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,530
two or more threads which access the same memory location and at least one of the threads modifies

76
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,620
the memory location.

77
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,860
So that is the case here.

78
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,900
We have a reading thread and writing thread.

79
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,850
These are safe only if the accesses are synchronized in some way.

80
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,870
Each access is made to happen before the next,

81
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,640
or the accesses are made atomically.

82
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,970
So how does using a shared mutex help us prevent a data race?

83
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:44,390
So we have these potentially conflicting reader and writer threads. The writer threat cannot get an exclusive

84
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:50,030
lock and execute the critical region until all the reader threads, which are currently accessing the

85
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,400
critical section, release their shared locks.

86
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:59,210
So this means that the accesses by these reader threads will happen before the access by the writer thread.

87
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:08,360
If the writing thread has an exclusive lock and reader threads want to get a shared lock, they cannot do that

88
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,640
until the writer has finished accessing the critical section and releases the exclusive lock.

89
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,180
So the access by the writing thread will happen before the access by these other reader threads.

90
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:28,190
So we have the reader and writer threads "happening before" the ones which could conflict. The accesses by

91
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,620
multiple reading threads do not have the happens before ordering, but that does not matter because they

92
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,490
do not modify the data, so they cannot conflict.

93
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:44,570
So we never have a situation in which a reader and a writer thread are executing the critical section

94
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,340
at the same time.

95
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,900
So there is no situation in which the reader and writer threads are interleaved.

96
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,360
OK, so that is it for this video.

97
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,660
I will see you next time.

98
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,480
But meanwhile, keep coding!
