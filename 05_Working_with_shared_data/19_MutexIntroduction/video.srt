00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,790
Hello again.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,130
In this video, we are going to start looking at things called "mutexes".

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,370
We saw in the last section that data races can occur when multiple threads try to access the same memory

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:21,330
location. And if we impose some sort of ordering on the threads as they access this location, then

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,980
we can avoid a data race.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,160
And a mutex is one of the tools for doing that.

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:35,550
I am afraid this is rather a tasteless analogy, so I apologize to anyone who is offended by it.

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:42,010
So let us step away from computers for a moment and go to more domestic matters.

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,290
We have a situation where we want to impose a rule that only one person can access the bathroom

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:49,880
at a time.

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:58,200
So a common solution is to put a lock on the door and everyone who uses the bathroom has to agree on

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,010
a protocol.

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:06,220
If the door is unlocked, then you can lock it, access the bathroom, and then you unlock it so the

14
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:12,730
next person can access the bathroom. If the door is locked, then you have to wait until it becomes

15
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,230
unlocked.

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,720
In computer science, the bathroom would be regarded as a "critical section".

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,620
This means some part of the program that must be able to execute without other parts of the program

18
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,580
interfering with it.

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,270
The bathroom door lock would be called a mutual exclusion object or "mutex" for short.

20
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:44,780
And we have this protocol in which two or more users of a resource agree that they will use the mutex to

21
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,700
control access to it. So provided everybody plays by the rules,

22
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,820
the mutex will prevent more than one user accessing the resource and executing the critical section

23
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,070
at any one time.

24
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:06,350
The mutex is a data structure. It is a very simple object that just has two states: it is either locked

25
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,130
or unlocked.

26
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,600
The way this works in threaded programs where we have multiple threads trying to access a resource is that

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,830
we associate a mutex with the resource and a thread can only access the resource if the mutex is unlocked.

28
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,500
So you can imagine we have several threads which want to access the resource.

29
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,540
They try to get a lock on the mutex.

30
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,430
Only one of them can succeed.

31
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,960
So the first one there, thread A, will look the mutex and the other threads will have to wait until the mutex

32
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,130
is unlocked by thread A.

33
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:49,850
Meanwhile, thread A has exclusive access to the resource and it can execute its critical region without

34
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,830
being interrupted [by another thread executing the same code]

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,600
Then when thread A finishes executing its critical region, it will unlock the mutex. Then one of the other

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,230
threads will be able to lock the mutex and access the resource.

37
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:12,690
So this means that, by the time any of threads B, C, D, etcetera, gets to access the resource, thread A will have

38
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,000
completed its access.

39
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,850
So the access by thread A will "happen before" any access by the other threads.

40
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:26,010
So we have been able to impose some ordering on the threads, how they access the resource.

41
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,530
And that means we have avoided a data race.

42
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:37,560
One other aspect of mutexes, which is more significant than it may sound: if a thread modifies the

43
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,190
resource, then all the threads that run after it will see the result of that modification.

44
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:50,270
So, for example, if thread A changes the value of a variable and then thread B runs, thread, B will

45
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,180
see the variable that was set by thread A.

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,500
When C++ added multi-threading, it provided a mutex class.
This is in the  standard header.

47
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:12,910
When we create a mutex object, it must be outside any of  the thread [functions] that are going to use it, but

48
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,740
it must be visible to all those thread [functions].

49
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:21,850
This usually means that if we have thread functions which are global functions, then the mutex has

50
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,310
to be a global or a static variable.

51
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:33,210
If the thread functions are member functions of a class, then the mutex will usually be a data member of that class,

52
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,180
although it could still be a global or static variable.

53
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,850
There are three main functions that we are interested in.
The lock member function will try to lock

54
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,540
the mutex.

55
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,750
And this call will not return until the mutex has been locked.

56
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,480
So that is what is called a "blocking" call.

57
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:01,850
If a thread tries to unlock the mutex and some other thread has got the mutex lock on, then this thread is going

58
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:07,670
to be stuck waiting for the call to return, until the other thread unlocks it and the thread is able to get

59
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,060
the lock.

60
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,230
An alternative to that is the try_lock function, which will return immediately.

61
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,010
This returns a boolean.

62
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,430
If we have a lock on the mutex, the result is true.

63
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,680
Otherwise, the return value is false.

64
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,400
So that is useful if you do not want to wait an indefinite amount of time to get the lock. You could

65
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,070
do something else and then try again.

66
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,920
And then finally, the unlock member function, which does what you might expect.
It releases the lock

67
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,640
on the mutex.

68
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:48,860
I have rewritten the code from the previous video to use a mutex. I have included the mutex header. I have

69
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:57,470
created a global mutex instance because the thread function is a global function and then, here is the critical

70
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,390
region of the thread function.

71
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,230
And before that, I have put in a call to lock the mutex.

72
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,410
And then after that I unlock the mutex.

73
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,210
So when each thread goes into this loop, it is going to try to lock the mutex.

74
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,900
When the lock call returns, that will mean the thread has [the lock on] the mutex.

75
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,620
It will mean that no other thread can execute [this code] while this critical region is being executed and then

76
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,450
it will unlock the mutex afterwards.

77
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,460
So let's see how that works.

78
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,510
There we are. It looks perfect, but as we saw, that does not necessarily prove anything.

79
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,840
So let's run it a few more times

80
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,190
and it looks through that has....

81
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,090
And it looks as though this has fixed the problem.

82
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,750
So this is what is happening. If we go back to the diagram that we had before,  I have added these locks and the

83
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,410
mutex so this is meant to be the mutex and these are the threads which are locking and unlocking it.

84
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:17,290
So thread one gets to run, it gets a lock on the mutex, and while thread one has a lock on the mutex,

85
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,010
no other thread can have a lock.

86
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,230
So thread one gets to write "abc" without being interrupted.

87
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,130
Then when it has finished, it unlocks the mutex, then some other thread can lock the mutex.

88
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,390
That thread can run one without being interrupted and that can write "def".

89
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,170
So we are going to get the proper output on the screen.

90
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,560
So that means that the output is no longer scrambled up.

91
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,150
We still have interleaved ordering because the threads can be scheduled to run in any order, but each

92
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,380
each thread's output is separate from the others.

93
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,390
It is not mixed up.

94
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:59,420
We have imposed a "happens before" relationship on the threats as they access the critical region, which

95
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,060
means they cannot interfere with each other.

96
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,290
Usually when we are using mutexes with data, we encapsulate them inside a class.

97
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,680
So, for example, if you want to have a vector, which is thread safe, we could create a class

98
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,790
which has a vector as a member and a mutex as another data member.

99
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,060
And then we have member functions which just forward to the vector's member functions, but with a lock, so

100
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:36,470
for example, when we call push_back on our thread safe class, this will get a lock on this mutex.

101
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,610
Then when the thread has looked the mutex, it will call the push_back member function on the vector and

102
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,430
then it will unlock it.

103
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,160
So this means that only one thread

104
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,830
can modify the vector at any one time.

105
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,260
Obviously, this is a rather simplistic example.

106
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:03,190
The mutex is an example of acquire and release semantics. When we lock the mutex, we acquire exclusive

107
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,440
access to the data it protects and to the critical region.

108
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:15,010
When we unlock the mutex, it releases the exclusive access to the data and it will also release the

109
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,070
results of any modification made to that data.

110
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,610
So the next thread which locks the mutex will acquire the results of that modification.

111
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:32,360
So these are acquire and release semantics are what imposes the ordering on the accesses to the variable.

112
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,670
There is no data race and the data will always be in a consistent state.

113
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:48,270
So we mentioned try_lock() before. This is typically how you use it. You have a loop in which you

114
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,890
keep calling try_lock().

115
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,670
If it does not get the lock, then this returns false and then you can do something else, and then

116
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,880
try again a bit later.

117
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,080
Then if the call does succeed, then it will return

118
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,540
true.

119
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,710
And you can carry on and do what... You can execute your critical region.

120
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,660
So you keep trying to get the lock in a loop until you succeed.

121
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,620
I have got some code which demonstrates this.

122
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,860
We just have the usual thread boilerplate at the top.

123
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,560
We have a mutex which both these threads are trying to lock.

124
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:37,310
Thread one will lock it immediately and then sleep for 500 milliseconds. Thread two will first

125
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,930
sleep and then try to get the lock.

126
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,300
It is going to keep trying to get the lock in a loop until it eventually succeeds.

127
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:54,080
At some point, thread one will wake up, it will unlock the mutex, and then thread two will get

128
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:01,730
the lock, this try_lock() call will succeed and the thread will jump out of the loop and execute its

129
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,470
critical region.

130
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,360
The main function just launches the threads and joins on them.

131
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,990
Nothing very exciting

132
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,230
there.

133
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,380
So we see task one and two both try to get the lock. Task one gets it straight away.

134
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:25,910
So by the time task two tries to get the lock, it's already been taken, it cannot get it, so it

135
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:32,150
sleeps and it tries again, sleeps, tries again, sleeps, and eventually task one releases the lock

136
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,920
and task two can get the lock.

137
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,990
Okay, so that's it for this video.

138
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,430
I'll see you next time.

139
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,000
But meanwhile, keep coding!
