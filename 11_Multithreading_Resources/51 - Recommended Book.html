<p>The recommended book for this course is "C++&nbsp;Concurrency in Action" by Anthony Williams, published by Manning.&nbsp;This is the definitive book on multithreading in C++.</p><p>The author is a member of the C++&nbsp;standard committee and is deeply involved in threading support in C++.</p><p>His code examples do not have to fit into a slide, so they are much more complete and realistic than the ones in this course.</p>
