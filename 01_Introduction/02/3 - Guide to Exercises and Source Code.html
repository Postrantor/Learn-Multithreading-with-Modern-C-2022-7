<p>Hello, and welcome to the course. Each lecture consists of a video, a set of exercises, solutions for the exercises, and a zip file with the solution source code.</p><p>The exercises repeat the material shown in the video. I would recommend that you do these from memory first, and if you are stuck, go back to the video. Don't look at the solution until you have at least tried to do the exercise.</p><p>There are also workshops at the end of each section. These are more challenging than the regular exercises.</p><p>The entire source code from all the videos in the course is available on my <a href="https://github.com/JamesRaynard/Multithreading-Course" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">github</a>.</p><p>I&nbsp;hope you find the course interesting and enjoyable!</p><p>James</p>
