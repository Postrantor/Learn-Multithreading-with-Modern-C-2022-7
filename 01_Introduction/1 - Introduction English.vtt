Hello and welcome to my course on C++ Multithreading.

1
00:05.310 --> 00:07.670
So why would you want to learn multithreading?

2
00:08.580 --> 00:13.710
The first reason is that Multithreading will allow you to take full advantage of the power of modern

3
00:13.710 --> 00:16.760
hardware, the way that chips are designed.

4
00:17.160 --> 00:21.350
They've given up trying to make one processor that can do one thing as fast as possible.

5
00:21.660 --> 00:27.360
And instead they're making lots of processors which can do lots of things as fast as possible, and to

6
00:27.360 --> 00:30.150
write  code which can take advantages that you need to learn

7
00:30.150 --> 00:34.920
multi threading. Multithreading also makes programs more responsive.

8
00:35.280 --> 00:40.470
If your program has to stop and do something that can take a long time, your users don't just have

9
00:40.470 --> 00:42.980
to sit there and get bored, they can do something else.

10
00:44.980 --> 00:52.150
The third reason is that everything is becoming multithreaded. Databases, Microsoft Office, games, everywhere

11
00:52.150 --> 00:53.360
you look, there's threads.

12
00:54.530 --> 00:57.370
So in today's world, multithreading is a valuable skill.

13
00:57.640 --> 01:02.740
If you can understand and work with multithreaded code, then you will definitely have an advantage.

14
01:04.930 --> 01:07.060
So what can you expect from this course?

15
01:07.390 --> 01:11.050
We start off by introducing concurrency, why it's important.

16
01:11.980 --> 01:18.700
Then we learn how to launch a thread. We look at these C++ thread class, we learn how to start multiple

17
01:18.700 --> 01:19.120
threads.

18
01:19.270 --> 01:23.170
And also at the problems that can occur when you have multiple threads.

19
01:25.490 --> 01:31.520
In the next section, we'll look at some techniques for working with shared data in multiple threads.

20
01:33.170 --> 01:38.690
in Section five, we learn some techniques for how to get threats to coordinate and synchronize with

21
01:38.690 --> 01:39.160
each other.

22
01:40.810 --> 01:44.440
Section six is atomic types and look free programming.

23
01:45.860 --> 01:48.760
In Section seven, we go on to asynchronous programming.

24
01:50.620 --> 01:55.720
In Section eight, we have an introduction to parallel programming, including the new parallel versions

25
01:55.720 --> 01:58.360
of algorithms, which are in C++ 17.

26
02:00.790 --> 02:03.130
And to finish off with, we do some practical work.

27
02:04.200 --> 02:08.220
We implement some data structures which you can use in your concurrent programs.

28
02:10.610 --> 02:17.830
Each video will have some PowerPoint slides like this one to explain the main points of each feature,

29
02:18.170 --> 02:24.170
and then there will be a demonstration in a compiler of some code which shows how these features work.

30
02:24.840 --> 02:31.100
There will be a set of exercises with each video so you can test your understanding and also solutions

31
02:31.280 --> 02:32.990
so you can check whether you got the answer right.

32
02:33.500 --> 02:37.190
And the source code for each video will also be available as well.

33
02:38.660 --> 02:39.300
So that's it.

34
02:39.370 --> 02:44.460
I hope to see you on the course and I hope you'll enjoy it. As I say, at the end of every video,

35
02:44.870 --> 02:45.560
keep coding!
