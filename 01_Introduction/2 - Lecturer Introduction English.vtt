Hello there.

1
00:00.930 --> 00:06.240
This is just a quick video to introduce myself,. So my name is James Raynard.

2
00:06.240 --> 00:09.690
That's what I look like, or rather it's what I looked like a few years ago.

3
00:09.950 --> 00:11.850
I don't have any recent photos.

4
00:12.750 --> 00:15.030
I live in England near the south coast.

5
00:16.960 --> 00:21.740
I began programming in C++ in 1993, which is quite a long time ago.

6
00:22.930 --> 00:29.650
I developed software in C++ for a number of large companies in the UK and continental Europe, mainly

7
00:29.650 --> 00:31.360
in banking and telecoms.

8
00:32.680 --> 00:36.780
I did a few things for a few years and now I work as a freelance instructor.

9
00:38.080 --> 00:45.550
I've been involved in C++ courses with Deutsche Bank, Citadel and Morgan Stanley in Britain, America

10
00:45.550 --> 00:53.230
and India. In my spare time I do ballroom dancing, or at least I used to before lookdown, also photography

11
00:53.230 --> 00:54.540
and walking in the country.

12
00:55.390 --> 00:56.850
So that's a little about me.

13
00:56.860 --> 00:58.410
And now let's get on with the course!
